# Hangman Game

## Description
Hangman is a popular word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game continues until the word is guessed correctly or the hangman is complete.

## Files
1. `main.py` - Python script containing the implementation of the Hangman game.

## Setup

## Usage

2. Follow the prompts on the screen to play the game.
3. Guess letters one by one to uncover the hidden word.
4. You have a limited number of guesses. Be careful not to use them all before guessing the word!

## Gameplay
- When you run the script, you will be prompted with a message indicating the number of letters in the word to be guessed and the number of incorrect guesses allowed.
- You will see underscores representing each letter of the word to be guessed.
- Enter a letter and press enter to see if it is in the word.
- If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
- If the letter is incorrect, part of the hangman will be drawn.
